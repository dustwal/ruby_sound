Future Features:
Add chords to vars / method calls
add effects to notes

Hopefull (long-term) Freatures:
simple text editor / score viewer to see score expand tonedefs
or to view full compiled scores rendered into human readable formats (might be
worth turning into Alda (or similar) score and use alda plugins to do that)

Bugs/Optimization:
treat rest value as duration not just number

save sounds at freq/duration for quick access later
