Future Features:
Add chords to vars / method calls
add chords(m,M,m7...) to lib
make tonedefs pass in sound as 'this'
inline operators to modify asound (more than what i have???) add to all specials
recursive effects
.sound files
documentation
clean code, refactor

Hopefull (long-term) Freatures:
simple text editor / score viewer to see score expand tonedefs
or to view full compiled scores rendered into human readable formats (might be
worth turning into Alda (or similar) score and use alda plugins to do that)

Bugs/Optimization:
treat rest value as duration not just number?
get rid of stream cache
